## What's the story?

I run my hobby 3d printing for 20 months. Yes, I am a noob. Along the way I looked for a software to do my CAD, and found Fusion 360 from Autodesk. So, I had to learn Fusion. Youtube offers great ressources, most important there is the AFusion channel run by Autodesk (https://www.youtube.com/user/AutodeskFusion360). There is a bunch of lovely people, and if I would have to name a few Brad, Aaron and Angelo helped me most with their tips and tricks. 

However, one day - I was finishing my illuminated death star (https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/5661-death-star-illuminated-mood-lamp-death-star ), I was looking for a thing taking more than a few days. Something to be my project for the winter. And, I was keen to create something running on tracks. Now I dislike building replicas of war machinery, so a tank was no solution to me. 

## A bulldozer!

I was using my favorite search engine duck duck go, and found Caterpillar as a big brand in the bolldozer manufacturers community. I sat down and thought what to do, and came up with these topics:

- no real replica, more a free style model of a bulldozer
- dimensions? who cares!
- radio controlled, and not steared by a gearbox, but two motors (I liked the challenge of programming my radio control)
- the blade at the fron should move up and down by servo motors

But how the f*** could I achieve these goals? I decided to create a gearbox first, add the motors to a motor stand, so I could test if running two independent tracks by an own motor each would be a cool thing. 

And what to tell: doing gears is easy enough in Fusion. I added some bearings, adjusted the tolerances, and had a woring gearbox a few hours later. I mirrored it, added some dirty casing around, and created a design for the tracks.

Stearing two tracks having a motor each was not as easy as I thought. But the guys at (https://openrcforums.com) helped out, so I got my radio control running quite soon.
